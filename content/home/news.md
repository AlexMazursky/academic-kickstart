<span style="color: #800000;">**(06.2020)** </span> First year of PhD courses done! I'm excited to deep dive into research this summer.

<span style="color: #800000;">**(03.2020)** </span> In light of COVID-19, I'm doing research and taking classes from home this quarter. Stay well, everyone!

<span style="color: #800000;">**(02.2020)** </span> I'm honored to have been named a [CDAC](https://cdac.uchicago.edu/) Doctoral Fellow. Check out the project I am working on with Pedro Lopes and Sihong Wang:  [Health Monitoring Based on Wearable Sweat Sensors](https://cdac.uchicago.edu/research/health-monitoring-based-on-wearable-sweat-sensors/)

<span style="color: #800000;">**(01.2020)** </span> My second journal paper is now published in Smart Materials and Structures: [A compact and compliant electrorheological actuator for generating a wide range of haptic sensations](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-665X/ab710c)

<span style="color: #800000;">**(11.2019)** </span> I kicked off the HCIntegration Lab's skillshare series by leading a discussion on mechanics of materials:
