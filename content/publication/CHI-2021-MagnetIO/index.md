abstract: "We propose a new type of haptic actuator, which we call MagnetIO, that is comprised of two parts: any number of soft interactive patches that can be applied anywhere and one battery-powered voice-coil worn on the user’s fingernail. When the fingernail-worn device contacts any of the interactive patches it detects its magnetic signature and makes the patch vibrate. To allow these otherwise passive patches to vibrate, we make them from silicone with regions doped with neodymium powder, resulting in soft and stretchable magnets. This novel decoupling of traditional vibration motors allows users to add interactive patches to their surroundings by attaching them to walls, objects or even other devices or appliances without instrumenting the object with electronics."
summary: "MagnetIO is a new type of haptic actuator comprised  of two parts: one battery-powered voice-coil worn on the user’s fingernail and many of interactive soft patches that can be attached onto any surface (everyday objects, user’s body, appliances, etc.). When the user’s fnger wearing our coil contacts any of the inter-active patches it detects its magnetic signature via magnetometer and makes the patch vibrate, adding haptic feedback to otherwise input-only interactions. It is this novel technical implementation, based on the decomposing the inner-workings of a linear resonant actuator, that gives rise to MagnetIO’s unique feature, it is a one-to-many haptic device, i.e., one active part (an electromagnetic-coil worn the fingernail) powers many passive actuators."
