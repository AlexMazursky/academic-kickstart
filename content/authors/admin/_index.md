I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science. I work with [Prof. Pedro Lopes](http://plopes.org) in the [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/) and am broadly interested in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with focus on creating haptic devices enabled by responsive materials. Grounded by a background in mechanical engineering, I like to operate at the intersection of HCI and materials science to unlock new interaction possibilities. Check out my recent CHI Paper: [MagnetIO, a wearable haptic actuator and battery-free vibrating patches to enable ubiquitous haptics!](https://lab.plopes.org/published/CHI21-MagnetIO.pdf )!

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Jeong-Hoi Koo](http://miamioh.edu/cec/academics/departments/mme/about/faculty-and-staff/koo-bio/index.html) at Miami University, where I studied smart fluids for haptic feedback as a [Research Fellow for NASA and the Ohio Space Grant Consortium](https://www.osgc.org). Additionally, I have worked as a visiting student researcher at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in the [Smart Systems and Structures Lab](http://sss.kaist.ac.kr/). 

Tangential to my core research, I enjoy learning more about soft robotics, human-robot interaction and artificial life. 

Outside of lab, I stay active through calisthenics, yoga, kettlebell training and hiking. Additionally, I am always trying to learn more about investing.
