	abstract = {Haptic feedback is desired for numerous applications including simulators, teleoperations, entertainment and more. While many devices today feature vibrotactile feedback, most do not provide kinesthetic feedback. To address the need for both vibrotactile and kinesthetic feedback, this study investigates the use of electrorheological (ER) fluids for their tunable viscosity under electrical stimulation. A prototype device containing ER fluid was designed and fabricated. The device operates based on pressure-driven flow of the fluid between charged plates due to user interaction with the touch contact surface. The prototype was tested using a dynamic mechanical analyzer to measure the actuator’s resistive force with respect to indentation depth for a range of applied voltages and frequencies. The results indicate that increasing the applied voltage causes an increase in the force produced by the actuator. Varying the supplied signal over a range of voltages and frequencies can convey a range of force and vibrational feedback. This range is sufficient to transmit distinct haptic sensations to human operators and demonstrates the design’s capability to transmit remote or virtual touch feedback conditions.},

	abstract = {Realistic haptic feedback is needed to provide information to users of numerous technologies, such as virtual reality, mobile devices, and robotics. For a device to convey realistic haptic feedback, two touch sensations must be present: tactile feedback and kinesthetic feedback. Although many devices today convey tactile feedback through vibrations, most neglect to incorporate kinesthetic feedback. To address this issue, this study investigates a haptic device with the aim of conveying both kinesthetic and vibrotactile information to users. A prototype based on electrorheological fluids was designed and fabricated. By controlling the electrorheological fluid flow via applied electric fields, the device can generate a range of haptic sensations. The design centered on an elastic membrane that acts as the actuator’s contact surface. Moreover, the control electronics and structural components were integrated into a compact printed circuit board, resulting in a slim device suitable for mobile applications. The device was tested using a dynamic mechanical analyzer to evaluate its performance. The device design was supported with mathematical modeling and was in agreement with experimental results. According to the just-noticeable difference analysis, this range is sufficient to transmit distinct kinesthetic and vibrotactile sensations to users, indicating that the electrorheological fluid–based actuator is capable of conveying haptic feedback.},

	abstract = {For a device to convey realistic haptic feedback, two touch sensations must be present: tactile feedback and kinesthetic feedback. Tactile feedback consists of the sensations felt at the surface of one’s skin and just underneath it, while kinesthetic feedback is felt in one’s joint and muscle nerves and provides information about position and movement. Though many haptic devices today convey tactile feedback through vibrations, most neglect to integrate kinesthetic feedback. To address this issue, this study investigates a haptic device with the aim of conveying both kinesthetic and vibrotactile information to users. To this end, a prototype device based on Electro-Rheological (ER) fluids was designed and fabricated. By controlling the ER fluid flow with the use of varying electric field strengths, the device can generate various haptic sensations. The design focused around an elastic membrane that acts as seal and the actuator’s contact surface. Moreover, the control electronics and structural components were integrated into a compact printed circuit board to miniaturize the device. The device was then tested using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) to evaluate its performance. During the experimental evaluation, the actuator’s resistive force along with the indented depth up to 1 mm were measured by varying the input voltage magnitude, frequency, as well as wave profiles. The results indicate that a range of possible force (kinesthetic) and vibrational (tactile) sensations were produced based on input voltage signals. According to the Just-Noticeable Difference (JND) analysis, this range is sufficient to transmit distinct kinesthetic and vibrotactile sensations to users, indicating that the ER haptic device is capable of conveying realistic haptic feedback.},

	abstract = {We present embedding a sensing capability to a slim haptic actuator based on electrorheological (ER) fluids, designed for conveying vivid kinesthetic and tactile sensations at small scale. Haptic feedback is produced through electrorheological fluid’s controllable resistive force and varies with the actuator’s deformation. To demonstrate the proposed actuator’s feedback in realistic applications, a method for measuring the actuator’s deformation must be implemented for feedback control. To this end, in this study, we incorporate a sensor design based on stress-sensitive resistive film in bending to the ER haptic actuator. The combined actuator and sensor module was tested for its ability to simultaneously actuate and sense the actuator’s state under indentation. The results show that the deflection sensor can accurately track the actuator’s displacement over its small stroke range. Thus, the proposed sensor may enable control of the output resistive force according to displacement.},
